## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Current Challenges
Packaging waste (bottles, cans, cartons) represents one of the largest environmental and cost concerns in the brewing industry. AB InBev faces several critical challenges:

- **Limited Visibility**: Current systems lack real-time visibility into packaging material usage, waste, and recovery across the supply chain
- **Inefficient Reverse Logistics**: Bottlenecks in recycling and reuse processes are difficult to identify and address
- **Slow Sustainability Progress**: Without comprehensive tracking, it's challenging to measure progress toward environmental goals
- **Cost Impact**: Packaging waste represents significant financial losses through inefficient material utilization
- **Regulatory Pressure**: Increasing environmental regulations require better tracking and reporting capabilities

### 1.2 Business Impact
- **Environmental**: Contributing to packaging waste and missed sustainability targets
- **Financial**: Lost value from discarded materials and inefficient logistics
- **Operational**: Suboptimal resource allocation and process inefficiencies
- **Regulatory**: Risk of non-compliance with environmental regulations
- **Brand**: Potential negative impact on sustainability reputation
